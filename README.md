pyfpdf: FPDF for Python
=======================

PyFPDF is a library for PDF document generation under Python, ported from PHP
(see [FPDF][1]: "Free"-PDF, a well-known PDFlib-extension replacement with many
examples, scripts and derivatives).

Compared with other PDF libraries, PyFPDF is simple, small and versatile, with
advanced capabilities, and is easy to learn, extend and maintain.

All developer hands on deck! (See below.) This branch of the library is
currently not tested so best stick to
[this version](https://github.com/reingart/pyfpdf) for now.

Features:
---------

 * Python 2.5 to 3.4 support
 * Unicode (UTF-8) TrueType font subset embedding
 * Internal/External Links
 * PNG, GIF and JPG support (including transparency and alpha channel)
 * Shape, Line Drawing
 * Cell/Multi-cell/Plaintext writing, Automatic page breaks
 * Basic html2pdf (Templates with a visual designer in the works)
 * Exceptions support, other minor fixes, improvements and PEP8 code cleanups
 * Tox tests
 
Installation Instructions:
--------------------------

To get the latest development version you can download the source code running:

```
  git clone https://github.com/alexanderankin/pyfpdf.git
  cd pyfpdf
  python setup.py install
```

You can also install PyFPDF from PyPI, with easyinstall or from Windows 
installers. For example, using pip:
```
  pip install fpdf
```

**Note:** the [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
(PIL) is needed for GIF support. PNG and JPG support is built-in and doesn't 
require any external dependency. For Python 3, 
[Pillow - The friendly PIL fork](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) is 
supported.

Developers:

There's a lot to sift through, please help. Code removal is presently as vital
as writing tests/features. There's a lot of stuff in this repository that I
deleted from master, please help sift through it and make it work/be 
readable/useful. Currently its cut down to what i can deal with. Let's ship
features, not code.

I'm in the process of learning to publish things to pypi, help!
